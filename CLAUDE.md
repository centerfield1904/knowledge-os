# knowledge-os

Multi-source digest pipeline that fetches stories from HN and Substack RSS, matches to user topics via semantic similarity, detects engagement opportunities, and delivers daily digests.

## Commands

```bash
# Run full digest pipeline
bash scripts/run_digest_v2.sh

# Run tests
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Sync reading log from a digest file
venv/bin/python -m knowledge_os.sync_reading_log knos-digest/YYYY-MM-DD.md

# Run engagement summary
venv/bin/python -m knowledge_os.engagement_summary

# Run local dashboard
venv/bin/python -m streamlit run src/knowledge_os/dashboard.py
```

## Environment

- **Package manager:** Always use `uv` — never bare `pip` or `pip3`
  - Install: `uv pip install <pkg> --python venv/bin/python`
- **Python:** Always use `venv/bin/python`, never system python
- **Database:** SQLite at `hn_digest_v2.db` — never DROP or DELETE without WHERE
- **Tests:** pytest with `tmp_path` fixtures for DB isolation (not `:memory:` — connections don't persist across `_get_conn()` calls)

## Architecture

```
fetch_stories.py ──┐
                   ├→ process_digest.py → knos-digest/YYYY-MM-DD.md
fetch_substack.py ─┘        ↓
                  storage_sqlite.py (SQLite via storage_interface.py ABC)
                             ↓
                  engagement.py (opportunity detection, comment sync)
```

- `config.json` — single source for topics, user, sources, storage config, thresholds
- `fetch_substack.py` — RSS fetcher for Substack feeds (config-driven, `feedparser` library)
- `storage_interface.py` — abstract base; `storage_sqlite.py` implements it
- `match_topics.py` — sentence-transformers semantic matching (heavy import, avoid in tests)
- `dashboard.py` — local Streamlit app with PM/Engineering mode switcher (sidebar radio); PM view: Overview (metrics + match quality), Browse, Authors; Engg view: Pipeline Health, Stories, Config, Simulator; reads DB and config directly, never writes to DB (except Config tab)

## Learning Goals

I'm an engineer using this project to build product management skills. When PM mode is active:
- Ask what problem a feature solves and for whom before discussing implementation
- Frame tradeoffs as user value vs effort, not technical complexity
- Surface: "What does success look like?" before writing code
- Reference pm/PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md for product context; pm/PM_NOTEBOOK.md for learning notes

## Code Conventions

- Config loading: use `load_config()` from `process_digest.py` or inline `json.load(open("config.json"))`
- DB access in production code: go through `storage_interface.get_storage()` factory
- DB access in `engagement.py`: uses raw `sqlite3` directly (separate schema)
- Errors/warnings: `print(..., file=sys.stderr)` — stdout is reserved for pipeline output
- Archive naming: `archive/YYYY-MM-DD_{stories,digest}.{json,txt}`, digest markdown in `knos-digest/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `published_at` (ISO 8601 string) is mandatory on every story dict from every source; `insert_item` accepts it and re-surfaces the story if the value is newer than what's stored
- `max_age_days` (config `settings.max_age_days`, default 7) — stories older than this are dropped in `_filter_by_age()` before topic matching; importable and testable
- HN username `vb7132` is hardcoded in `engagement.py` and `engagement_summary.py`

## Testing

- All tests in `tests/` — run with `venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Use `tmp_path` fixture for SQLite (not `:memory:`)
- Don't import `match_topics` or `sentence_transformers` in tests — they load heavy ML models
- Test pure functions directly; mock network calls
